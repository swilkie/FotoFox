							<h2 class="note-title">A Note From Jona</h2>
							<p class="note-text">The world today is looking for men and women,
								Who are not for sale
								Who are honest, sound from centre to circumference, true to the heart's core
								With consciences as steady as the needle to the pole
								Who will stand for the right if the heavens totter and the earth reels
								Who can tell the truth and look the world right in the eye
								Who neither brag nor run
								Who neither flag or flinch
								Who can have courage without shouting it
								In whom the courage of everlasting life runs still, deep and strong
								Who know their message and tell it
								Who know their place and fill it
								Who know their business and attend to it
								Who will not lie, shirk or dodge
								Who are not too lazy to work, nor too proud to be poor
								Who are willing to eat what they have earned and wear what they have paid for
								Who are not ashamed to say "No" with emphasis

								God is looking for them. He wants those who can unite together around a common faith - who can join hands in a common task - and who have come to the kingdom for such a time as this. God give us such as them.

								Not only will they be better prepared to fulfil their duties as a citizen, they should make a better friend, a better husband, a better father, a better wife, because free people do. They will, in short, be better prepared to live, and when their hour comes, they will know better how to die because free people do.

								â€“ Athol Murray</p>
